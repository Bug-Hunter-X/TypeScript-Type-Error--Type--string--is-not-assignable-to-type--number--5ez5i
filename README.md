# TypeScript Type Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a string is assigned to a variable expected to be a number.  The error message is  `Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.`

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to correct the issue using type guards or type assertions.

This example highlights the benefits of TypeScript's static type checking, which prevents runtime errors caused by type mismatches.
